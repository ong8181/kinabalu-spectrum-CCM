This repository contains R scripts to reproduce the results reported in Kitayama et al. "Temperature is a dominant driver of distinct annual seasonality of leaf litter production of equatorial tropical rain forests" (2021) <i>Journal of Ecology</i> http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.13500. _bioRxiv_ version of this manuscript is available <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/454058" target="_blank">here</a>.

# Overview
In Kitayama et al. (2021), we analyzed time series of leaf and flower litter productions taken from equatorial tropical rain forests in Borneo. We found that there is a distinct one-year periodicity for leaf litter productions. In addition, by applying newly developed causal analysis method, spectrum CCM, we showed that the distinct one-year periodicity is driven by air temperature.
